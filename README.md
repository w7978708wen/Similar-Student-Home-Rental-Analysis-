# Similar-Student-Home-Rental-Analysis-

To simulate the analysis that I created for my university's student home rental business (which is an academic project), I manually created two small data sets to capture the general trends observed. For example, there are particular months that have higher application volumes than others. Some buildings and room types are also more popoular than others.

I aim to use my data sets to display my exploratory data analysis, dashboard creation, design principles, and data story-telling techniques.
